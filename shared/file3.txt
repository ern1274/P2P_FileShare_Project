Really long story I found online:
Happened about 18 years ago. I was running a small part time IT service/consulting company, 
and had a gelato company as a client. They had an urgent server problem, 
so I pulled into their parking lot in my beat up 93 Camry, went in and got to work.

While I was in the office working, their tow company shows up and asks if the Camry is a customer. 
The guy that let me in the back to work on the server said "nope he's not a customer" while mixing stuff, 
I remember hearing him say that from the other room.

After a few minutes another employee comes in the office and tells me that my car is being towed. 
Of course I head out back to see my car on the truck and let the driver know I'm working at the business. 
The driver looks at me and says: In 20 years he's never dropped a car on his truck without being paid, 
and "it's not happening today, that will be 200 dollars."

I said "That's cool, just give me a printed receipt so I can bill the owner of the business the invoice 
amount plus 100 dollars in materials markup, and 60 dollars for the time I've spent dealing with you. 
This will make money for both of us today."

Dude just glared at me while he dropped my car, then got in his truck, and hauled ass.
